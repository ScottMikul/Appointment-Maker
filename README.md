# Appointment-Maker
This project allows the user to add an appointment. The add appointment form is validated using spring validation and an error message is 
displayed at the top of the form if there are problems with the form. 

The date to be added can be picked with the jquery date picker.

A datatable is used to show the data from the the database. 
The results can be filterd by a searchbox.
